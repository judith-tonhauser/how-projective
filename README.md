# Variability in the information structural status of projective content

## JD's tasks

1. analyze exp 1b like exp 1a and write up

2. analyze exp 2 and write up

## JT comments
- NAI predicts projectivity, but the individual triggers also explain additional variance in projectivity 
	==> look at the factive verb experiment to see if the contents that the triggers were paired with accounts for the variance accounted for by the triggers
	i.e., are the trigger effects reducible to content effects that the triggers were paired with
