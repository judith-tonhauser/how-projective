# Variability in the information structural status of projective content

## JD's tasks

1. visualize individual variation for both exps -- does correlation between projectivity and NAIness hold in individuals?
2. analyze and write up results sections of exps

# JT comments
- NAI predicts projectivity, but the individual triggers also explain additional variance in projectivity 
	==> look at the factive verb experiment to see if the contents that the triggers were paired with accounts for the variance accounted for by the triggers
	i.e., are the trigger effects reducible to content effects that the triggers were paired with
