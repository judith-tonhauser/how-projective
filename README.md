# How projective is projective content? Experimental investigations of gradient projectivity and at-issueness

This is the repository that accompanies the paper

"How projective is projective content? Experimental investigations of gradient projectivity and at-issueness", Judith Tonhauser, David I. Beaver, and Judith Degen. (ms) Under review with Journal of Semantics.

The directory `experiments` contains the experimental files used to run Exps 1a, 1b, 2a, and 2b.

The directory `paper` contains the files used to generate the paper.

The directory `results` contains the (anonymized) data from all four experiments as well as the R scripts used for analysis and visualization. Note: what is referred to as a "trigger" in these files corresponds to what is referred to by "target expression" in the paper (see footnote 1 in the paper).
