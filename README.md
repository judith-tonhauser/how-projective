# How projective is projective content? Gradience in projectivity and at-issueness

This is the repository that accompanies the following paper and data management use case (DMUC) chapter:

- Tonhauser, Judith, Beaver, David I., and Degen, Judith (2018). How projective is projective content? Gradience in projectivity and at-issueness,  *Journal of Semantics*, 35(3), pp. 495-542.

- Tonhauser, Judith, Beaver, David I., and Degen, Judith (2022). Managing web experiments for psycholinguistics: An example from experimental semantics/pragmatics. In *A. Berez-Kroeker, B. McDonnell, E. Koller, and L. Collister(Eds.). Open Handbook of Linguistic Data Management*, pp. 539-546, The MIT Press. doi: 10.7551/mitpress/12200.001.0001.


The directory `dmuc` contains the DMUC paper. 

The directory `experiments` contains the experimental files used to run Exps 1a, 1b, 2a, and 2b.

The directory `paper` contains the files used to generate the Journal of Semantics paper. Figure B (by-item ratings in Exp 1b), referenced in the paper, can be found in results/exp1b/graphs/.

The directory `results` contains the (anonymized) data from all four experiments as well as the R scripts used for analysis and visualization. Note: what is referred to as a "trigger" in these files corresponds to what is referred to by "target expression" in the paper (see footnote 1 in the paper).
