# How projective is projective content? Gradience in projectivity and at-issueness

This is the repository that accompanies the paper

"How projective is projective content? Gradience in projectivity and at-issueness", Judith Tonhauser, David I. Beaver, and Judith Degen (2018). *Journal of Semantics*, 35(3), pp. 495-542.

and the Data Management Use Case (DMUC)

"Managing data for experimental semantics and pragmatics", Judith Degen and Judith Tonhauser (under review).


The directory `dmuc` contains the DMUC paper. 

The directory `experiments` contains the experimental files used to run Exps 1a, 1b, 2a, and 2b.

The directory `paper` contains the files used to generate the Journal of Semantics paper. Figure B (by-item ratings in Exp 1b), referenced in the paper, can be found in results/exp1b/graphs/.

The directory `results` contains the (anonymized) data from all four experiments as well as the R scripts used for analysis and visualization. Note: what is referred to as a "trigger" in these files corresponds to what is referred to by "target expression" in the paper (see footnote 1 in the paper).

The directly `pilots' contains the pilots for at-issueness and projection referenced in footnote 8 of the Journal of Semantics paper.
